# Tailwind CSS Datepicker

This project is a free and open source datepicker library which uses the utility-first classes from Tailwind and the JavaScript from another open source library called [Vanilla JS Datepicker](https://github.com/mymth/vanillajs-datepicker).

This [Tailwind CSS Datepicker](https://flowbite.com/docs/plugins/datepicker/) is part of a larger library of components and interactive elements called Flowbite. Although it can also be used independently from the main library, we encourage you to check out the whole [Tailwind components library from Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/).

## Getting started

If you want to use the **Tailwind Datepicker** plugin using JavaScript you will need to include it into your project via NPM:

```bash
npm i @themesberg/tailwind-datepicker --save
```

After you've installed the NPM library, you will need to import the `Datepicker` module:

```javascript
import Datepicker from '@themesberg/tailwind-datepicker/Datepicker';
```

Initialize a new element using the `Datepicker` constructor and optionally add custom options based on your needs:

```javascript
const datepickerEl = document.getElementById('datepickerId');
new Datepicker(datepickerEl, {
    // options
}); 
```

If you want to use the **Tailwind Date Range Picker** you have to import the `DateRangePicker` module:

```javascript
import DateRangePicker from '@themesberg/tailwind-datepicker/DateRangePicker';
```

Then in the same fashion you can initalize a date range picker component by using the `DateRangePicker` constructor:

```javascript
const dateRangePickerEl = document.getElementById('dateRangePickerId');
new DateRangePicker(datepickerEl, {
    // options
}); 
```
